Bradley Crowe and Dena [Last Name],                   FOR RETALIATORY EVICTION,
     Defendants/Counter-Plaintiffs.                   FRAUD, AND VIOLATIONS OF
                                                      TENANT PROTECTION LAWS

==============================================================================

COMES NOW Defendants Bradley Crowe and Dena [Last Name], appearing pro se, 
and for their Amended Counterclaim against Plaintiff, state and allege:

==============================================================================
                              PARTIES
==============================================================================

1. Defendants are tenants residing at Lexington Flats, Unit #[___], Eagan, 
   Minnesota 55123 ("the Premises") for approximately FIVE (5) YEARS.

2. Plaintiff Velair Property Management is the landlord/property manager, 
   operating through:
   - Lisa Burg, On-Site Property Manager
   - Ryan [Last Name], Broker (license oversight)
   - Corporate management/ownership

3. The Premises receives government funding/subsidies, requiring GOOD CAUSE 
   for any non-renewal or termination of tenancy.

==============================================================================
                    STATEMENT OF FACTS - THE FULL PICTURE
==============================================================================

                         FIVE YEARS OF PERFECT TENANCY

4. Defendants have resided at the Premises since approximately 2020, when 
   the building was BRAND NEW.

5. Throughout their ENTIRE five-year tenancy, Defendants have:
   a. Paid rent on time EVERY SINGLE MONTH;
   b. Received ZERO lease violations;
   c. Received ZERO complaints from neighbors;
   d. Maintained the unit in excellent condition;
   e. Been told by management the unit has been "kept very well."

                    LISA BURG'S PERSONAL MOTIVE

6. Lisa Burg became property manager at Lexington Flats only DAYS before 
   the incidents giving rise to this case.

7. Upon information and belief, Lisa Burg wants to PERSONALLY MOVE INTO 
   Defendants' specific apartment unit.

8. Lisa Burg previously managed another property where her relationship 
   with residents deteriorated to such an extent that SOMEONE LIT HER CAR 
   ON FIRE IN BROAD DAYLIGHT.

9. Lisa Burg's pattern of conflict with residents at multiple properties 
   demonstrates that SHE is the source of problems, not the tenants she 
   targets.

10. Former property manager Krusteen [Last Name], who remains in contact 
    with Defendants, nearly obtained a RESTRAINING ORDER against Lisa Burg 
    at another property due to her problematic behavior.

                    PREMEDITATED PLAN TO REMOVE DEFENDANTS

11. In approximately AUGUST 2025 - at least TWO MONTHS before Defendants' 
    lease was set to expire - Defendants' apartment unit was listed for 
    rent on rental websites.

12. This listing occurred BEFORE any alleged lease violations and BEFORE 
    Plaintiff gave any notice of intent not to renew.

13. This proves the decision to remove Defendants was made BEFORE any 
    alleged misconduct - the "lease violations" are pretextual.

                    THE LEASE RENEWAL BAIT-AND-SWITCH

14. Plaintiff OFFERED Defendants a new lease renewal.

15. After Defendants raised concerns about Lisa Burg's behavior and 
    communicated with corporate management, Plaintiff suddenly WITHDREW 
    the lease renewal offer.

16. Plaintiff has NEVER provided a legitimate, good-cause reason for 
    refusing to renew Defendants' lease as required by the property's 
    government funding requirements.

                    PROTECTED ACTIVITIES AND RETALIATION

17. Defendants engaged in the following protected activities:

    a. ACCOUNTING DISPUTE: Defendant Bradley Crowe identified errors in 
       Plaintiff's accounting records. Defendant proved the errors existed 
       and the matter was resolved in Defendant's favor. This embarrassed 
       management.

    b. ESA ACCOMMODATION: Defendants have an Emotional Support Animal 
       (dog). A maintenance employee expressed hostility toward the ESA.

    c. REASONABLE MAINTENANCE REQUEST: On or about [DATE], Defendant Dena 
       politely requested a maintenance employee remove his shoes before 
       entering the unit. The employee had just come from a sewer job and 
       had a noticeable odor. This is a reasonable request.

    d. COMPLAINTS ABOUT LISA BURG: Defendants complained to corporate 
       management about Lisa Burg's hostile, unprofessional, and violent 
       behavior toward residents.

    e. ATTORNEY GENERAL COMPLAINT: Defendant filed a formal complaint with 
       the Minnesota Attorney General's Office. The AG's Office called 
       Defendant in response.

    f. CEASE AND DESIST DEMANDS: Defendants sent formal Cease and Desist 
       letters regarding harassment and retaliation.

                    THE THREE-HOUR RETALIATION

18. Within THREE (3) HOURS of Defendant Dena's shoe request, Plaintiff 
    issued a "Major Lease Violation" notice.

19. This notice was issued by Lisa Burg, who had been on the job only 
    THREE (3) DAYS.

20. The violation notice falsely alleged Defendant Dena was "abusive" 
    toward maintenance staff. This allegation is completely fabricated.

                    THE OFFICE INCIDENT AND VIDEO EVIDENCE

21. When Defendant Bradley Crowe went to the office to discuss the 
    violation notice, he remained CALM throughout.

22. Lisa Burg immediately became hostile, screamed "I'm in training!" 
    at Defendant, slammed the door, and called police.

23. When police arrived, Defendant requested they review the security 
    camera footage that would prove his calm demeanor.

24. LISA BURG REFUSED TO SHOW POLICE THE VIDEO FOOTAGE.

25. Ms. Burg's refusal to produce exculpatory evidence demonstrates 
    consciousness of guilt and that her allegations are fabricated.

                    CORPORATE COMPLICITY

26. In email communications with Defendant, Lisa Burg's supervisor at 
    corporate headquarters confirmed that corporate management is 
    SUPPORTING Lisa Burg's actions against Defendants.

27. Corporate's support of Lisa Burg - despite her documented history 
    of conflict with residents and Defendants' spotless 5-year record - 
    demonstrates institutional retaliation.

                    BROKER'S FAILURE OF OVERSIGHT

28. Ryan [Last Name] serves as the licensed broker with supervisory 
    responsibility over property management.

29. The broker has failed to:
    a. Investigate Defendants' complaints;
    b. Ensure compliance with fair housing and tenant protection laws;
    c. Prevent Lisa Burg's pattern of harassment;
    d. Ensure good-cause requirements are followed.

30. The broker's failure to exercise proper oversight enables and 
    ratifies the retaliatory conduct.

                    ADDITIONAL RETALIATORY CONDUCT

31. When Defendants attempted to view other available units at the 
    property (to potentially relocate), Lisa Burg refused to acknowledge 
    that Defendants were current residents of five years.

32. This petty, hostile behavior further demonstrates retaliatory intent.

==============================================================================
                         LEGAL CLAIMS
==============================================================================

                    COUNT I: RETALIATORY EVICTION
                    (Minn. Stat. § 504B.441)

33. Minnesota law prohibits landlords from retaliating against tenants 
    who exercise their legal rights or complain about conditions.

34. Defendants engaged in multiple protected activities including 
    complaints to management, complaints to the Attorney General, and 
    exercise of their rights under the lease.

35. The eviction was filed within 90 days of these protected activities, 
    establishing a PRESUMPTION OF RETALIATION under § 504B.441, Subd. 2.

36. The three-hour timeline between the shoe request and the "Major 
    Violation" notice is direct evidence of retaliatory intent.

                    COUNT II: VIOLATION OF GOOD CAUSE REQUIREMENT

37. The Premises receives government funding that requires GOOD CAUSE 
    for non-renewal of any tenancy.

38. Plaintiff has failed to provide any legitimate good-cause reason 
    for refusing to renew Defendants' lease.

39. The true reasons - Lisa Burg's personal desire for the apartment, 
    retaliation for complaints, and Defendants' assertion of their 
    rights - do not constitute good cause.

40. Plaintiff's non-renewal violates applicable federal and state 
    regulations governing subsidized housing.

                    COUNT III: FRAUD/PRETEXTUAL EVICTION

41. Plaintiff has alleged "lease violations" as the basis for eviction.

42. These alleged violations are fabricated and pretextual.

43. The TRUE motivation for this eviction includes:
    a. Lisa Burg's personal desire to occupy Defendants' apartment;
    b. Retaliation for Defendants' complaints and protected activities;
    c. Retaliation for Defendants proving management's accounting errors.

44. Plaintiff's reliance on fabricated violations constitutes fraud 
    upon the Court.

                    COUNT IV: BREACH OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

45. Plaintiff has engaged in a pattern of harassment that has 
    interfered with Defendants' quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

==============================================================================
                         DAMAGES
==============================================================================

46. As a result of Plaintiff's conduct, Defendants have suffered:
    a. Severe emotional distress and anxiety;
    b. Damage to reputation;
    c. Time and resources defending against frivolous eviction;
    d. Threat of displacement after five years;
    e. Loss of their well-maintained home;
    f. Other damages to be proven at trial.

==============================================================================
                      PRAYER FOR RELIEF
==============================================================================

WHEREFORE, Defendants/Counter-Plaintiffs respectfully request:

1. DISMISS Plaintiff's eviction complaint WITH PREJUDICE;

2. DECLARE the non-renewal void for lack of good cause;

3. ORDER Plaintiff to renew Defendants' lease;

4. AWARD statutory damages under Minn. Stat. § 504B.441;

5. AWARD compensatory damages for emotional distress;

6. AWARD punitive damages for Plaintiff's willful and malicious conduct;

7. ORDER Plaintiff to produce all video surveillance footage;

8. REFER this matter to:
   a. Minnesota Attorney General for investigation of housing violations;
   b. HUD/applicable funding agency for subsidy compliance review;
   c. Minnesota Department of Commerce for broker license review;

9. AWARD costs and pro se litigation expenses;

10. GRANT such other relief as the Court deems just.

                    DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Defendants demand a jury trial on all issues so triable.
