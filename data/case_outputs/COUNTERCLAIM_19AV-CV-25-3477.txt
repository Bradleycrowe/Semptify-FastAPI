COUNTY OF DAKOTA                                      FIRST JUDICIAL DISTRICT

Velair Property Management,
     Plaintiff,
                                                      Case No.: 19AV-CV-25-3477
vs.
                                                      DEFENDANT'S COUNTERCLAIM
Bradley Crowe and Dena [Last Name],                   FOR RETALIATORY EVICTION
     Defendants/Counter-Plaintiffs.

==============================================================================

COMES NOW Defendants Bradley Crowe and Dena [Last Name], appearing pro se, 
and for their Counterclaim against Plaintiff, state and allege as follows:

                              PARTIES

1. Defendants are tenants residing at Lexington Flats, [Unit #], Eagan, 
   Minnesota 55123 ("the Premises").

2. Plaintiff Velair Property Management is the landlord/property manager 
   of the Premises, operating through its agent Lisa Burg, Office Manager.

                      JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this counterclaim pursuant to 
   Minnesota Statutes § 504B.441.

4. Venue is proper in Dakota County as the Premises is located therein.

                           BACKGROUND

5. Defendants have been tenants at the Premises for approximately FIVE (5) 
   YEARS, maintaining continuous occupancy since approximately 2020.

6. Throughout their entire tenancy, Defendants have:
   a. Paid rent on time every month without exception;
   b. Received ZERO lease violations;
   c. Received ZERO complaints from neighbors or management;
   d. Maintained the Premises in good condition.

                      PROTECTED ACTIVITIES

7. Defendants engaged in the following activities protected under Minnesota 
   law:

   a. COMPLAINT ABOUT ACCOUNTING ERRORS: Defendant Bradley Crowe identified 
      and reported errors in Plaintiff's accounting records/ledger. Defendant 
      demonstrated these errors were incorrect, and the matter was resolved 
      in Defendant's favor.

   b. ESA ACCOMMODATION: Defendants have an Emotional Support Animal (dog) 
      as a reasonable accommodation. Plaintiff's maintenance employee 
      expressed hostility toward the ESA.

   c. REASONABLE REQUEST REGARDING PREMISES: On or about [DATE], Defendant 
      Dena politely requested that Plaintiff's maintenance employee remove 
      his shoes upon entering the unit. The employee had just come from a 
      sewer-related job and had a noticeable odor. This was a reasonable 
      request to protect Defendants' home and belongings.

                      RETALIATORY CONDUCT

8. Within THREE (3) HOURS of Defendant Dena's reasonable request regarding 
   the maintenance employee's shoes, Plaintiff issued a "Major Lease 
   Violation" notice against Defendants.

9. This "violation" notice was issued by Lisa Burg, who had been employed 
   as Office Manager for only THREE (3) DAYS at the time.

10. The violation notice falsely claimed that Defendant Dena was "abusive" 
    toward the maintenance employee. This allegation is completely false.

11. When Defendant Bradley Crowe went to the office to discuss this matter:
    a. Lisa Burg became immediately hostile;
    b. She screamed "I'm in training!" at Defendant;
    c. She slammed the door;
    d. She called the police on Defendant, who had remained calm throughout.

12. When police arrived, Defendant Bradley Crowe requested they review the 
    security camera footage that would show his calm demeanor.

13. Lisa Burg REFUSED to show the police the security camera footage.

14. Plaintiff's refusal to provide video evidence that would exonerate 
    Defendant demonstrates consciousness of guilt and that the allegations 
    against Defendants are fabricated.

                      PATTERN OF HARASSMENT

15. Prior to the eviction filing, Defendants sent Plaintiff:
    a. A Formal Cease and Desist Demand regarding Harassment and Retaliation;
    b. A stop letter addressed to Ms. Burg.

16. Defendant filed a complaint with the Minnesota Attorney General's Office 
    regarding Plaintiff's conduct. The Attorney General's Office contacted 
    Defendant in response to this complaint.

17. Following Defendants' protected complaints, Plaintiff escalated to 
    filing this eviction action—further evidence of retaliation.

                         LEGAL BASIS

18. Minnesota Statutes § 504B.441 prohibits a landlord from retaliating 
    against a tenant who has:
    a. Complained to a governmental agency about violations;
    b. Complained to the landlord about repairs or conditions;
    c. Exercised rights under the lease or law.

19. Under § 504B.441, Subd. 2, there is a REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION of 
    retaliation when adverse action occurs within 90 days of protected 
    activity.

20. The eviction was filed within 90 days of Defendants' protected 
    activities, establishing the presumption of retaliation.

21. The THREE-HOUR timeline between the shoe request and the "Major 
    Violation" notice is direct evidence of retaliatory intent.

                          DAMAGES

22. As a result of Plaintiff's retaliatory conduct, Defendants have suffered:
    a. Emotional distress and anxiety;
    b. Time and resources defending against frivolous eviction;
    c. Damage to reputation;
    d. Threat of homelessness and displacement;
    e. Other damages to be proven at trial.

                      PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Defendants/Counter-Plaintiffs respectfully request that this 
Court:

1. DISMISS Plaintiff's eviction complaint with prejudice as retaliatory 
   under Minn. Stat. § 504B.441;

2. AWARD Defendants statutory damages under § 504B.441, Subd. 1(3), 
   including up to $500 or actual damages, whichever is greater;

3. AWARD Defendants reasonable attorney's fees and costs (or pro se 
   litigation expenses);

4. AWARD Defendants such other and further relief as the Court deems 
   just and equitable;

5. ORDER Plaintiff to preserve all security camera footage from the 
   dates in question.

                    DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Defendants hereby demand a jury trial on all issues so triable.
