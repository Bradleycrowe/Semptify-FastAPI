     Defendants.                                      VIDEO SURVEILLANCE AND
                                                      FOR SANCTIONS

==============================================================================

COMES NOW Defendants Bradley Crowe and Dena [Last Name], appearing pro se, 
and respectfully move this Court for an Order:

1. Compelling Plaintiff to immediately produce and preserve all video 
   surveillance footage from the Lexington Flats property;

2. Imposing sanctions for spoliation if footage has been destroyed; and

3. Drawing an adverse inference against Plaintiff if footage is unavailable.

This Motion is based upon the following Memorandum, the attached Affidavit, 
and all files and records in this matter.

==============================================================================
                              MEMORANDUM
==============================================================================

                           INTRODUCTION

Plaintiff has filed an eviction action alleging that Defendant engaged in 
threatening or abusive behavior toward property management. This allegation 
is false. Video surveillance footage exists that would conclusively 
demonstrate Defendant's calm demeanor during the incident in question. 
Plaintiff's agent refused to provide this footage to law enforcement when 
requested, and Defendants now seek Court intervention to compel its production.

                        STATEMENT OF FACTS

1. On or about [DATE], Defendant Bradley Crowe went to the Lexington Flats 
   property management office to discuss a "Major Lease Violation" notice 
   that had been issued against Defendants.

2. The property management office is equipped with video surveillance 
   cameras that record activity in and around the office.

3. During this visit, property manager Lisa Burg became hostile toward 
   Defendant, screamed at him, slammed the door, and called police.

4. Defendant Bradley Crowe remained calm throughout this entire encounter.

5. When police officers arrived on scene, Defendant specifically requested 
   that they review the security camera footage, which would show his 
   calm demeanor and Ms. Burg's hostile behavior.

6. Lisa Burg REFUSED to show the police officers the video surveillance 
   footage.

7. Ms. Burg's refusal to show exculpatory video evidence to law enforcement 
   demonstrates that the footage contradicts Plaintiff's allegations and 
   would be favorable to Defendants.

8. Plaintiff's eviction complaint relies on allegations of Defendant's 
   alleged threatening behavior - the very conduct the video would disprove.

                         LEGAL ARGUMENT

I. DEFENDANTS ARE ENTITLED TO DISCOVERY OF RELEVANT EVIDENCE

Under Minnesota Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 26.02, parties may obtain 
discovery of any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party's 
claim or defense. Minn. R. Civ. P. 26.02(a).

The video surveillance footage is directly relevant to:
- Plaintiff's claim that Defendant engaged in threatening behavior;
- Defendant's defense that no such behavior occurred;
- Defendant's counterclaim for retaliatory eviction;
- The credibility of Plaintiff's agent Lisa Burg.

II. PLAINTIFF HAS A DUTY TO PRESERVE THE EVIDENCE

A party has a duty to preserve evidence when litigation is reasonably 
anticipated. Patton v. Newmar Corp., 538 N.W.2d 116 (Minn. 1995).

Plaintiff's duty to preserve arose no later than:
- The date Ms. Burg called police (litigation was foreseeable);
- The date Defendants sent the Cease and Desist letter;
- The date Plaintiff filed this eviction action.

Any destruction of the footage after these dates constitutes spoliation.

III. ADVERSE INFERENCE IS WARRANTED IF FOOTAGE IS UNAVAILABLE

When a party destroys or fails to preserve relevant evidence, Minnesota 
courts may instruct the jury that it may infer the evidence would have 
been unfavorable to that party. Patton, 538 N.W.2d at 120.

Ms. Burg's refusal to show the video to police - at the very moment it 
was most relevant - creates a strong inference that the footage contradicts 
Plaintiff's version of events.

IV. SANCTIONS ARE APPROPRIATE FOR SPOLIATION

If Plaintiff has destroyed or failed to preserve the video footage, this 
Court should impose sanctions including:
- Adverse inference instruction to the jury/factfinder;
- Dismissal of Plaintiff's eviction complaint;
- Award of attorney fees and costs to Defendants.

                           CONCLUSION

The video surveillance footage is the single most important piece of 
evidence in this case. It will show:

✓ Defendant Bradley Crowe was CALM during the office visit
✓ Lisa Burg was the HOSTILE party who escalated the situation  
✓ Plaintiff's allegations of "threatening behavior" are FALSE
✓ This eviction is RETALIATORY, not based on actual misconduct

Plaintiff's agent refused to show this footage to police because it 
would expose the false basis for this eviction. Defendants are entitled 
to this evidence, and the Court should compel its immediate production.

                        PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Defendants respectfully request that this Court:

1. ORDER Plaintiff to immediately produce all video surveillance footage 
   from Lexington Flats property management office and common areas from 
   [DATE OF INCIDENT] through the present;

2. ORDER Plaintiff to preserve all such footage pending resolution of 
   this matter;

3. If the footage has been destroyed or is unavailable, ORDER an adverse 
   inference instruction that the footage would have shown Defendant 
   acted calmly and non-threateningly;

4. AWARD Defendants sanctions, costs, and fees associated with this Motion;

5. GRANT such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

                    AFFIDAVIT OF BRADLEY CROWE
==============================================================================

STATE OF MINNESOTA  )
                    ) ss.
COUNTY OF DAKOTA    )

I, Bradley Crowe, being first duly sworn, state as follows:

1. I am a Defendant in the above-captioned matter and make this Affidavit 
   based on my personal knowledge.

2. I have been a tenant at Lexington Flats, Eagan, Minnesota for 
   approximately five (5) years.

3. On or about [DATE], I received a "Major Lease Violation" notice from 
   property management. This notice was issued within approximately THREE 
   HOURS of my partner Dena politely asking a maintenance worker to remove 
   his shoes in our unit.

4. I went to the property management office to discuss this notice and 
   understand what was happening.

5. When I arrived at the office, I was calm and polite. I did not raise 
   my voice, make threats, or act in any aggressive manner.

6. Lisa Burg, the property manager, immediately became hostile. She 
   screamed "I'm in training!" at me, slammed the door, and called the 
   police.

7. I remained outside the office, calm, and waited for police to arrive. 
   I said words to the effect of "Good, I'll wait" when she said she was 
   calling police.

8. When police officers arrived, I specifically asked them to review the 
   security camera footage from the property management office. I knew 
   the cameras would show that I was calm and Ms. Burg was the one acting 
   hostile.

9. The police officers asked Ms. Burg to show them the video footage.

10. Ms. Burg REFUSED to show the police officers the video.

11. I believe Ms. Burg refused to show the video because it would prove 
    I was calm and would contradict the allegations she was making 
    against me.

12. I have never received any lease violations in my approximately five 
    years of tenancy at Lexington Flats prior to Ms. Burg's arrival as 
    manager.

13. I have always paid my rent on time.

14. I believe this eviction is retaliation for:
    a. Pointing out errors in Plaintiff's accounting/ledger;
    b. Having an Emotional Support Animal;
    c. Dena's reasonable request about the maintenance worker's shoes;
    d. My complaint to the Minnesota Attorney General's Office.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.
