## 🎯 WHY THIS ORDER MATTERS

### **BAD FLOW (SHOES BEFORE SOCKS):**
❌ Trying to file court forms before uploading documents
❌ Setting deadlines before knowing what to file
❌ Getting AI analysis with no data
❌ Preparing for court with incomplete evidence

### **GOOD FLOW (SOCKS BEFORE SHOES):**
✅ Gather materials → Organize them → Research law → Get AI help → Create forms → Set deadlines → Practice → File → Review

---

## 🧠 THE PSYCHOLOGY

### **Progressive Disclosure**
- Don't overwhelm with everything at once
- Reveal next step only when ready
- Each step builds confidence

### **Context Grouping**
- Documents belong together
- Timeline is its own phase
- Legal research is grouped
- Court prep is sequential

### **Natural Progression**
Each step **depends on the previous one**:
1. Can't build timeline without documents (dates come from docs)
2. Can't research without knowing timeline (need to know what laws apply when)
3. Can't get AI insights without data (AI needs evidence to analyze)
4. Can't fill forms without AI analysis (forms need strategy)
5. Can't set deadlines without forms (deadlines come from what you're filing)
6. Can't prepare for hearing without knowing deadlines (prep is time-sensitive)
7. Can't file without being prepared (must review first)
8. Can't do final review without filing (review confirms filing is correct)
